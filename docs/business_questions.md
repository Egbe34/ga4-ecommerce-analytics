# Business Questions – GA4 E-commerce Analytics

1) Funnel performance: How do sessions flow to add_to_cart and purchases? What is the overall conversion rate (CR)?
2) Channel effectiveness: Which channel groups drive the most purchases and revenue? Which have the best CR and AOV?
3) Trends over time: How do sessions, purchases, revenue, CR, and AOV evolve by day/week?
4) Drop-off analysis: At which funnel stage (sessions → add_to_cart → purchase) is the biggest loss, by channel?
5) High-value segments: Which channels/dates show highest AOV? Are there patterns worth prioritizing?
6) Product signals (optional NLP): Which product names/titles/topics correlate with higher conversion?
7) ML insight: Can we score channel/date segments by likelihood to convert and highlight “high-intent” segments?
